# Analyzing the Impact of System Architecture on the Scalability of OLTP Engines for High-Contention Workloads

## Abstract

Main-memory OLTP engines are being increasingly deployed on multicore servers that provide abundant thread-level parallelism. However, recent research has shown that even the state-of-the-art OLTP engines are unable to exploit available parallelism for high contention workloads. While previous studies have shown the lack of scalability of all popular concurrency control protocols, they consider only one system architecture - a non-partitioned, shared everything one where transactions can be scheduled to run on any core and can access any data or metadata stored in shared memory. In this paper, we perform a thorough analysis of the impact of other architectural alternatives (Data-oriented transaction execution, Partitioned Serial Execution, and Delegation) on scalability under high contention scenarios. In doing so, we present Trireme, a main-memory OLTP engine testbed that implements four system architectures and several popular concurrency control protocols in a single code base. Using Trireme, we present an extensive experimental study to understand i) the impact of each system architecture on overall scalability, ii) the interaction between system architecture and concurrency control protocols, and iii) the pros and cons of new architectures that have been proposed recently to explicitly deal with high-contention workloads.
